# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

As part of the prework required for the bootcamp I had to make a simple webpage. To create the webpage I used HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Then I stored the project on Github. This webpage is something anyone who is trying to learn how to create websites can look at as a reference. I have worked with some HTML and CSS. I have also worked with some loops and functions before using Python. The syntax of Javascipt is new to me and I need to brush up on my skills since it has been quite a long time since I have used any of this knowledge.
